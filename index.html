    <h2 class="h2">The Biography</h2>


    <p>
      I born in a <strong>Pretty</strong> city.<br> <strong>Pretty</strong> as me. Calling Quito located in Ecuador. South
      America!
    </p><br>

    <p class="p1">
      I attended many highschools in my life. I went to "3 November School" when I was a child. I went to "Technical
      Aviation HighSchool" when I was teenat. Before coming to Georgian college, I went to "Pontifical Catolic
      University", where I took Biology as a career. Anyway, life changes, so currently I'm studying computer
      programming
      as a post-secondary program in Georgian College.
    <p>

    <p class="p2">
      When I was a child I liked to eat fried chicken and veggies. So I created my own recipe with fried chicken and
      veggies!
      I think this is my best achiement.

      But back to the subject. My best achiement has been on the painting jorney, where I participated in several
      contests
      thanks to my skills, and thus I have won international tournaments.
    </p>

    <p class="p3">
      I consider myself a very ambitious person and zero conformist. I always aspire for more and I like to achieve what
      I
      set out to do. Therefore, my main goal is develope and improve my programming skills in the financial field to
      make
      my own bussines.
      But one of my fisrt goals for now is complete my program and go back my country to see my little sisters.
